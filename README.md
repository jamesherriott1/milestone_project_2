# Pontoon Card Game

## This is my milestone 2 project

I decided to got with a card game as I wanted to create something simple and fun.

I chose pontoon as it's a game I've always played from a young age and it's easy for anyoe to learn. It's also quite competitive.
I built this game with the intention of showing my undestanding of javascript, although at times it's provennto be a challenge for4 me to get to grips with it compared to css and html. Because of this I wanted to do something quite simple that would still show I understand how it works.
