# Pontoon Card Game

## This is my milestone 2 project

I decided to got with a card game as I wanted to create something simple and fun.

I chose pontoon as it's a game I've always played from a young age and it's easy for anyoe to learn. It's also quite competitive.
I built this game with the intention of showing my undestanding of javascript, although at times it's provennto be a challenge for4 me to get to grips with it compared to css and html. Because of this I wanted to do something quite simple that would still show I understand how it works.

## Tests

I've added some html to the head section of the index.html file.

I've added a h2 and div to the dealer section in te body and checked in the browser and everyhting seems to be working fine. Tested in W3C, no errors.
<!--add screenshots from assets folder once uploaded to file - screenshot1-->

Added h2 to the player section of the body and 2 buttons. Also added a h3 which showed and empty header warning when tested. This is something I want to add to once the javascript is added if it works.
<!-- add screenshot 2 -->

<!-- need to test the h3 once I've added the javascript. not sure if what I have in mind will work but I'll run test once I get to that point and show results in here -->

Added css to the player and dealer cards and added a font family. Tested code and no errors were found. <!-- add screen shot-->
I did forget to add a source for the font family so i will go back and test again once I've added the source.
<!-- find fonts in google fonts and add to css file -->

Still having trouble with the fonts. Will try and add them as a file rather than a link.
<!-- I copied and pasted the head element html from my first milestone project and the fonts are now working fine on all sections. -->

<!-- add screenshot of url with green background and correct fonts -->

I added a background color and it gave me an error when checked in the css validator. I changed from an rgb to dark green and it gives a valid css code, however, it still hasn't changed the background color. It seems to be a link issue.
<!-- come back to css link as it still isn't working -->
Solved the issue with the css. I used the head html from my first milestone projectand changed the href to suit the css folder for this project. I now have the gree background.


Added card.images/ file to assets folder and added img element to html 
<!-- need to test code for images file -->

Tested latest html code after adding the new head element code. I had an error saying there was no title. I've added the title and retested and have no errors. I also had the trailing slash error which i kept getting in my first project.
<!-- add screen shot showing errors -->

Added some more styling to the dealer and player cards sectons of the css file. All tested , no errors in the code, however, it seems to have shifted the cards to the left of the screen.
<!-- revert back to previous css and add each variable 1 at a time -->
The display variable was causing the problem with the deck moving to the left. I removed that and it works fine.

Added img element to the player cards section in html as I noticed it was missing when I loaded the url to test the page. Realised this gave me a duplicate id so I changed the id to a class which solved the issue.
<!-- might have to make changes later and give both sections their own id -->
