# Pontoon Card Game

## This is my milestone 2 project

I decided to got with a card game as I wanted to create something simple and fun.

I chose pontoon as it's a game I've always played from a young age and it's easy for anyoe to learn. It's also quite competitive.
I built this game with the intention of showing my undestanding of javascript, although at times it's provennto be a challenge for4 me to get to grips with it compared to css and html. Because of this I wanted to do something quite simple that would still show I understand how it works.

## Tests

I've added some html to the head section of the index.html file.

I've added a h2 and div to the dealer section in te body and checked in the browser and everyhting seems to be working fine. Tested in W3C, no errors.
<!--add screenshots from assets folder once uploaded to file - screenshot1-->

Added h2 to the player section of the body and 2 buttons. Also added a h3 which showed and empty header warning when tested. This is something I want to add to once the javascript is added if it works.
<!-- add screenshot 2 -->

<!-- need to test the h3 once I've added the javascript. not sure if what I have in mind will work but I'll run test once I get to that point and show results in here -->

Added css to the player and ealer cards and added a font family. Tested code and no errors were found. <!-- add screen shot-->
I did forget to add a source for the font family so i will go back and test again once I've added the source.
<!-- find fonts in google fonts and add to css file -->
